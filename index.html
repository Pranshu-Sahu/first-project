            In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of
            computing and information.

              This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
              entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
              introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
              support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented
              with optional advanced sections.</em>
